# Readme File

1. Pytest (Most Common)

Status: Fully supported
Integration: Excellent integration with Playwright
Command-line execution: Yes
Fixtures for browser and context: Built-in with pytest-playwright
Async support: Yes
You can use pytest-playwright plugin to easily manage browsers, contexts, pages, etc.

2. Unittest (Pythonâ€™s built-in testing framework)

Status: Supported
Integration: Manual setup required (no built-in fixtures)
Command-line execution: Yes
Async support: Requires manual handling with asyncio

3. Behave (For BDD â€“ Behavior Driven Development)

Status: Supported, but not officially maintained by Playwright team
Integration: Manual integration with Playwright
Use case: Gherkin-style BDD tests

Difference Between playwright and pytest-playwright

Playwright
----------
pip install playwright
Core Playwright API

This install playwright core (Including Browser Automation and Bindings) but not the pytest integration


Playwright with Pytest
----------------------
pip install pytest-playwright
Adds pytest integration (fixtures and CLI Supports)
- This install the pytest plugin for Playwright
- Write tests using pytest structure (def test_)
- Use fixture like page, browser, etc without manually launching the browser
- Easily runs the test with pytest commands

pytest is a testing framework for Python --- its used to write simple, scalable and readable test cases.



GIT Configuration
-----------------

1. Install and configure git-scm - https://git-scm.com/downloads - Git-Bash
Basic command - https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html


2. Configure the GitHub Account - github.com

git -v

git config --global user.name "username"

git config --global user.email sam@gmail.com

git add .

git add <filename>

git commit -m "Added Commit Message"

git push origin main


No body push the code directly to main branch 
- We will create a branch - JIRA_9383
- You will make the changes - Linked to JIRA_9383
- You will make sure everything is working as expected
- You will raise - PR - Pull Request - JIRA_9383 ---> main
- QA Manager <Approver> - Compare the changes - Merge the change - Reject the PR with Review comments - QA - Work on Review comment - Raise a PR


Assignement - 24th Sep

- Programs in PY - 
    - Create a array and print all the value of an array
    - Create a Numeric Array and Perform the Addition of all value
    - Create a String Array and Calculate the word count of each word in an Array
    
Assignement - 25th Sep  
    - Create 5 functions -
        - Function 1 - Will take the input user age, user phone number
        validate the phone number(10 Digit)
