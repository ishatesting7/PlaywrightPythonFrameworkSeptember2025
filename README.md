# Readme File

1. Pytest (Most Common)

Status: Fully supported
Integration: Excellent integration with Playwright
Command-line execution: Yes
Fixtures for browser and context: Built-in with pytest-playwright
Async support: Yes
You can use pytest-playwright plugin to easily manage browsers, contexts, pages, etc.

2. Unittest (Pythonâ€™s built-in testing framework)

Status: Supported
Integration: Manual setup required (no built-in fixtures)
Command-line execution: Yes
Async support: Requires manual handling with asyncio

3. Behave (For BDD â€“ Behavior Driven Development)

Status: Supported, but not officially maintained by Playwright team
Integration: Manual integration with Playwright
Use case: Gherkin-style BDD tests

# Readme File

Difference Between playwright and pytest-playwright

Playwright
----------
pip install playwright
Core Playwright API

This install playwright core (Including Browser Automation and Bindings) but not the pytest integration


Playwright with Pytest
----------------------
pip install pytest-playwright
Adds pytest integration (fixtures and CLI Supports)
- This install the pytest plugin for Playwright
- Write tests using pytest structure (def test_) - 
    - Filename should be starting with test_
    - Function def test_
- Use fixture like page, browser, etc without manually launching the browser
- Easily runs the test with pytest commands

pytest is a testing framework for Python --- its used to write simple, scalable and readable test cases.



GIT Configuration
-----------------

1. Install and configure git-scm - https://git-scm.com/downloads - Git-Bash
Basic command - https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html


2. Configure the GitHub Account - github.com

git -v

git config --global user.name "username"

git config --global user.email sam@gmail.com

git add .

git add <filename>

git commit -m "Added Commit Message"

git push origin main


No body push the code directly to main branch 
- We will create a branch - JIRA_9383
- You will make the changes - Linked to JIRA_9383
- You will make sure everything is working as expected
- You will raise - PR - Pull Request - JIRA_9383 ---> main
- QA Manager <Approver> - Compare the changes - Merge the change - Reject the PR with Review comments - QA - Work on Review comment - Raise a PR


Assignement - 24th Sep 
- Everyone should do the GIT setup
- Programs in PY - 
    - Create a array and print all the value of an array
    - Create a Numeric Array and Perform the Addition of all value
    - Create a String Array and Calculate the word count of each word in an Array
    
Assignement - 25th Sep  
    - Create 5 functions -
        - Function 1 - Will take the input user age, user phone number
        validate the phone number(10 Digit)
        - Function 2 - Anagram test, 'silent', 'listen' - if letter are same then display output - Both are anagram
        - Function 3 - Take garbage data - "932489JSNjsjnd&*@334" - Segregate the data - Numeric, Special Char, Small case, Upper case

Locators -
--------

HTML - 

<input type="submit" class="button arc sjand ndsanj ndsan" value="Log In">

TagName
Attribute
Value

--> CSS - Locator
1. If you are aware about ID then the css selector would be - #id
2. If you are aware about class then the css selector would be - .classname
    - If there is blank space fill that with . -- .button.arc.sjand.ndsanj.ndsan
3. If we are aware about tagname and value - Then css selector would be - 
[attribute = "value"] -- [type = "Submit"]
4. If we are aware about tagname attribute and value - Then css selector would be - tagname[attribute="value"] -- input[type='submit']
5. parent -- child -- grandchild -- grandgrandchild
6. ID + TagName -- tagName#idvalue
7. Class + TagName -- tagName.className

For Validating the Locator - https://selectorshub.com/selectorshub/


python - Inbuilt - 

- page.get_by_role() to locate by explicit and implicit accessibility attributes.
- page.get_by_text() to locate by text content.
- page.get_by_label() to locate a form control by associated label's text.
- page.get_by_placeholder() to locate an input by placeholder.
- page.get_by_alt_text() to locate an element, usually image, by its text alternative.
- page.get_by_title() to locate an element by its title attribute.
- page.get_by_test_id() to locate an element based on its data-testid attribute (other attributes can be configured).


--> Xpath - 

//input[@name='username']

Relative - 
    - // - It start with '//'
    - Xpath inbuilt method
    - If we are aware about tagname, attribute and value - //tagname[@attribute=
    'value']

    - Using AND and OR - 
    - //input[@name="customer.address.street" and @class = 'input']
    - //input[@name="customer.address.street" or @class = 'input']

    - By text content
    - //h2[text()='Generate tests with the Playwright Inspector']
    - //h2[contains(text(),'Generate tests with the Playwright Inspector')]
    - //h2[normalize-space(text())='Generate tests with the Playwright Inspector']

    - By using contains()
    - //h2[contains(@id,'intro')]

    - By using starts-with()
    - //h2[starts-with(@id,'intro')]

    - last()/postition()
    - (//h2[starts-with(@class,'anc')])[last()]
    - (//h2[starts-with(@class,'anc')])[4]
    - (//h2[starts-with(@class,'anc')])[position()=1]

    - Xpath axes

    - Using Parent/Child
    - //div[@class='theme-doc-markdown markdown']/div/h2

    - Using Ancestor/Descendant
    - //div[@class='theme-doc-markdown markdown']/descendant::h3
    - //div[@class='theme-doc-markdown markdown']/ancestor::h3

    - following and preceding
    - sibling


Absolute - 
    - 
    - 





Avoid - /html/body/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/form/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[2]/input
