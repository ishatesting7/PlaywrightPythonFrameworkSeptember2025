Difference Between playwright and pytest-playwright

Playwright
----------
pip install playwright
Core Playwright API

This install playwright core (Including Browser Automation and Bindings) but not the pytest integration


Playwright with Pytest
----------------------
pip install pytest-playwright
Adds pytest integration (fixtures and CLI Supports)
- This install the pytest plugin for Playwright
- Write tests using pytest structure (def test_)
- Use fixture like page, browser, etc without manually launching the browser
- Easily runs the test with pytest commands

pytest is a testing framework for Python --- its used to write simple, scalable and readable test cases.



GIT Configuration
-----------------

1. Install and configure git-scm - https://git-scm.com/downloads - Git-Bash
Basic command - https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html


2. Configure the GitHub Account - github.com

git -v

git config --global user.name "username"

git config --global user.email sam@gmail.com
